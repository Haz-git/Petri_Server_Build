# Petri (Server-Side/Back-End)
A *research-focused* web-app designed for increasing lab productivity and workflow.

- This repository houses the server-side of my web application *Petri*. As such, most of the details mentioned here are largely back-end related. If you want to learn about my client-side please visit [Petri's client-side repository](https://github.com/Haz-git/Petri_Client_Build).

### About The Project
---
*Petri* was developed as a passion project during the pursuit of my Master's degree in Human Biology (more specifically, Microbiology and Molecular Biology). While I was performing research, I was frequently frustrated at the lack of research(specifically wetlab)-oriented applications to make our lives easier. Now, good ones do exist, but they were far from simple and much too expensive for our small lab's use-case.

Furthermore, as a self-taught developer, I wanted to learn more about the near-infinite field of software engineering and web development. I wanted a project that would challenge my knowledge and let me exercise my creativity. In the end, I got what I wanted--working through this project massively improved my knowledge about full-stack software development.

My obsession with coding, creation, and research led to the development of *Petri*.
